# Method of Moments for Antenna Simulation
An implementation of the method of moments (MoM) in Julia using the thin-wire approximation for simulating antennas. The theory behind the implementation is presented in docs/. Several examples are provided in Julia notebook form to showcase the capabilities of the code.
